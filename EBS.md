✅ Real-Life Use Cases for Amazon EBS
🖥️ 1. Hosting a Web Application on EC2
Scenario:
You run a web app (e.g., Node.js, Django, Laravel) on EC2.

How EBS is used:

Stores the app code

Stores configs, logs, and runtime files

Root volume (OS)

EBS provides persistent disk storage, so even if the EC2 stops, your data isn’t lost.

🛢️ 2. Running a Database on EC2 (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
Scenario:
You choose to self-host your database on EC2 (instead of using RDS).

How EBS is used:

EBS volumes (gp3 or io2) store database files (data, indexes, logs)

You can provision high IOPS or throughput for heavy workloads

Snapshots for backups

📌 This is common in custom setups where you need full DB control.

🧠 3. Machine Learning or AI Model Training
Scenario:
You run ML training on EC2 (e.g., with PyTorch, TensorFlow), using large datasets.

How EBS is used:

EBS volumes store datasets and model checkpoints

Easy to scale size or speed depending on I/O needs

📌 Use gp3 or st1 depending on whether you need fast IOPS or throughput.

🗃️ 4. Data Analytics & Batch Processing
Scenario:
You run periodic data processing jobs using Apache Spark or custom scripts.

How EBS is used:

Store intermediate files and large data inputs

Use separate EBS volumes for temp storage and logs

📌 Use st1 (throughput optimized HDD) for large sequential reads.

🔁 5. Backup & Restore with Snapshots
Scenario:
You want to back up the current state of your application or database.

How EBS is used:

Create snapshots (stored in S3)

Restore volumes from snapshots across regions/accounts

Version control for disaster recovery

📌 Common in regulated industries (e.g., healthcare, finance).

📈 6. High Availability Architecture (with RAID, Multi-AZ, or Snapshots)
Scenario:
You build fault-tolerant EC2 systems with redundancy.

How EBS is used:

Combine EBS volumes in RAID 0 or RAID 10

Use snapshots to replicate data across AZs

Create failover volumes or AMIs

🧪 7. CI/CD Pipelines on EC2
Scenario:
You host your own CI/CD server (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab Runner).

How EBS is used:

Store build artifacts, logs, Docker images

Use IOPS-optimized EBS for high-speed builds
